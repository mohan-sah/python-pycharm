<h3>Reborn Rich </h3>
 <p>i like the acting of grandfather and the hero the most.
    the story, the plot and the concepts are ufff. To this time i have watched it twice.</p>

<h3> Kingdom</h3>
<p>i like the fights and stategy most. i like sheer will power of breaking through,
    the leadership Shin commands.</p>

<h3>Misaeng: Incomplete Life</h3>
<p>i like the problem solving and people reading ability of Gae-rae and oh-sang shik.
    i goto know about office culture and some tips like why you have to do standardized 
    protocols and the things you are doing is a group task so reusablity is important.
    also documentation. </p>
